    + When I select a text and press tab, instead of indenting the text it creates a tab space at the end of the line. FIXED.

    + The color preview window should have the resize corner in the top left corner, not in the bottom left corner like it is now. FIXED.

    + The color wheel can only change the background colour. It cannot change the rest of the colors. It should change the color the cursor is standing on. FIXED.
