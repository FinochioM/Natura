    + If I enter a filename or directory that does not exist, the program crashes. FIXED.

# Undo errors:
    + When pressing CTRL+Z, the program crashes. (only after having typed some text before AND not having the text selected) FIXED.

# Errors:

    + Files have empty lines when opened from the editor. FIXED.
    + When I select a text and press tab, instead of indenting the text it creates a tab space at the end of the line. FIXED.
    + Multi line comment does not work. When I select more than one line, if I press CTRL+/ it should comment all the lines. FIXED.
    + CTRL+V when pasting something from outside the editor does not work. FIXED.
    + CTRL+F crashes when I try to type something to search on the search bar. FIXED.

    + The color preview window should have the resize corner in the top left corner, not in the bottom left corner like it is now. FIXED.

    + If I scroll down in the global config file, the position gets reset to the top after a few seconds. FIXED.
    + The color wheel should move with the color preview window. FIXED.
    + The color wheel can only change the background colour. It cannot change the rest of the colors. It should change the color the cursor is standing on. FIXED.
    + CTRL+Z and CTRL+Y not workin properly. FIXED.
    + indent_using and tab_size do not seem to be working correctly. FIXED.
    + The cursor_as_block only works if I change it from false to true, not from true to false. FIXED.
